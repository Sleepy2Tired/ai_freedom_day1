You've got this! Consistency is the key to success, especially when you're feeling drained. Remember, it's not about perfection; it's about progress. 

**3 Action Steps to Stay Consistent:**

1. **Set Micro-Goals**: Break tasks into tiny, manageable chunks. Instead of aiming for an hour of work, commit to just 5-10 minutes. Youâ€™ll be surprised how that tiny commitment can lead to momentum!

2. **Create a Routine**: Establish a simple daily ritual that signals itâ€™s time to work, even when you're tired. A quick stretch, a cup of coffee, or a motivational playlist can help shift your mindset.

3. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself when you complete even the smallest task. This builds positive reinforcement and keeps your motivation highâ€”even on low-energy days!

Now get out there and crush it! ðŸ¥³
